# CovidCrashers

## Creation

### About

Covid Crashers was my first ever game created in unity. I used this project as a way to learn about c# in unity, lighting, ui, pixel art, and sounds. It currently only has 1 level, however I want to keep the project as similar as when it was originally created, so I will not be adding more.

Move your character with the arrow keys. Use the spacebar to swing your sword. You must attack the covid-19 virus, and defeat the final boss. Be careful not to fall off the map!

### Where can I play?

You can find the build location in the `/Build` directory. The build is for windows, if you would like another version, feel free to message me on building for another platform.
